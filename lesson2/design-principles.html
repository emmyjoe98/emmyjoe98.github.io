            <h2>White Space/<br>Clean Design<br>(Walmart)</h2>
            <img src="images/walmart_whitespace.jpg" alt="Picture of Walmart Home Page">
            <p>I chose Walmart <a href="https://www.walmart.com">(Walmart.com)</a> 
                for clean design and good use of white space because their 
                design is simply and very neat. It allows the user to understand what is 
                going on but does not overwhelm them with options. There are four direct 
                areas of the site you can go to from this section but you also have the 
                option of looking at more categories from an expandable menu.</p>
        </section>
        <section class = "ulta">
            <h2>Visual Hierarchy<br>(Ulta)</h2>
            <img src="images/ulta_visualhierarchy.jpg" alt="Picture of Ulta Home Page">
            <p>I chose Ulta <a href="https://www.ulta.com">(Ulta.com)</a> for good use of visual 
                hierarchy because the sale they are promoting is a much larger portion of the screen 
                compared to other items on their page. Then your eye goes to a coupon that is valid 
                for you to use; again, encouraging you to buy something from them. Lastly, your eye 
                goes to their basic header of the shopping cart, menu bar, search bar, and store locator.</p>
        </section>    
        <section class = "lightinbox">
            <h2>Hick's Law<br>(Light in the Box)</h2>
            <img src="images/lightinthebox_hicks.jpg" alt="Picture of Light in the Box Home Page">
            <p>I chose Light in the Box <a href="https://www.lightinthebox.com">(Light in the Box.com)</a>
                for Hickâ€™s law because the site shows very clearly how many different options they try 
                to throw in your face at once. Just from this image there are 14 different ways you 
                could get into the website, but unless you know specifically what you are looking for 
                it is going to take a while to decide what to do next.</p>
